# DirectFerriesTechTestSOA

This is a technical test soloution for a WebAPI. I didn't know if the soloution was SOA or Microservice so I just provided a simple SOA implenetation.

## Installation

No install needed just copy files to desired location. There are 4 tests (NUnit and Moq) that cover:

controller_action_should_return_a_ok_result

controller_action_should_return_a_bad_request_result_for_no_space_between_fullname_and_a_null_date

controller_action_should_return_a_user_object_with_values_for_specific_start_date (this is wrapped in a responseDTO object)

service_should_return_a_user_object_with_values_for_specific_start_date

## Usage

Run Project and enter parameters in Swagger. These are:

Fullname (needs a space to denote fullname)

Dob ("yyyy-mm-dd" format)

TargetDate (this is used as an offset but if left blank a default date is provided to the service layer)

## Contributing

The offset days can be configured in appsettings for the task "A list that shows the 14 days before the userâ€™s next birthday (days of week (Mon, Tue, Wed etc.)".
Currently it is set as 14 but can be changed to get a larger or smaller list of days before the next birthday.

Please make sure to update test setup data if the as appropriate if the offset days is changed.

I used Fine Code Coverage (xtn see attached documant CodeCoverage.docx for results). I wrapped the extention methods in function properties in the service so i could mock them in the tests for better code coverage.

Normally I would include a .gitignore file however since I am just adding code to a non dev/test/uat/sit/prod repo I have omitted this item.
